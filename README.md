# gondos

This is template prototype for my next project (maybe). This may not for everyone. I'm trying to craft this because I want to get started quickly whenever needed.

:construction: Work in progress

### Requirements
- [Just a command runner](github.com/casey/just)
- [Go](go.dev)

### Run
Execute `just` to see list of available commands.

```shell
$ just
```
