# gondos

This is template prototype for my next project (maybe). This may not for everyone. I'm trying to craft this because I want to get started quickly whenever needed.

>This example is a simple list app where user can register and login. Authentication using JWT Token. User can create list and add item to the list, also deletion is avalable. Accessible both in rest and graphql.

### Requirements
- [Just a command runner](github.com/casey/just)
- [Go](go.dev)

### Run
Execute `just` to see list of available commands.

```shell
$ just
```
